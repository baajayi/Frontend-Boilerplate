       <h2> Master Mobile UX</h2>

<p>      In the video, Kray Mitchell described the principles governing mobile UX design and development. It is essential to master these principles because mobile devices have already taken over the gadgets market. Rewiring my mind towards a mobile-first design approach would help me be a successful developer because I will be solving issues that mobile users face and probably did not know. Some of the principles include strategically placing ads so as not to irritate users, designing forms that can be filled without hassle on a mobile device, placing strategic buttons where they can easily be reached if the device is operated by the thumb and so forth. </p> 
<h2>Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript (OOP) </h2>
<p> programming in JavaScript is similar to OOP in other programming languages. It involves breaking down codes into objects that have methods and properties. The three main concepts in OOP are Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism. Encapsulation makes a method available for implementation without seeing the inner workings of the method. Polymorphism is when different objects implement the same methods in their own ways. Inheritance is when the methods and properties of an already existing object are implemented by another object in its own specific way.
Classes defines the blueprint for an object. When an object is created as an instance of a class, it inherits all the properties and methods of that class. A constructor function defines the properties and methods of an object. Object, Array and Function are JavaScript built-in constructor functions.</p>
<h2>Object Method .this </h2>
<p> We use “this” to give an object method access to the information it needs to do its job.
For example;
<span> const superHero = {
  	firstName: "Thor",
 	 superPower: "Mojoli",
  	desc : function() {
   		 return "His name is " + this.firstName + " and his super power is " + this.superPower;
  }
};
console.log(superHero.desc())
output;
His name is Thor and his super power is Mojoli </span></p>
